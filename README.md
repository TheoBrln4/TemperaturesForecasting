# üå°Ô∏è Deep Learning Forecasting Daily Temperatures in Paris with EDA, API, Interfaces and Dockerization on EC2 servers

Development of a forecasting model for temperatures with interfaces, API and dockerization on a EC2 server.

## Introduction

This project aims to forecast daily temperatures in Paris using historical weather data. The first step focuses on exploring patterns in humidity, wind, and cloud cover to understand how they relate to temperature. The goal is to develop a predictive model and deploy it through an interactive API.
